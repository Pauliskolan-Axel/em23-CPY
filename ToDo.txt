List of Issues ELEMIK 2022

Clone repo by clicking Vs Code button. You now have a local repo (folder) on your harddrive. Take note where it is.
In Vs Code, add folder /Volumes/CIRCUITPY/ to the workspace so you have both folders in sight. Save the workspace in your local repo folder. use this next time you want to work with the code.

Download a project bundle to HDD.
Drag project bundle to local repo from Finder to vs Code, replacing libs and Code.py. Delete possibly created files that start with '._'
In Vs Code, drag files from local repo to /Volumes/CIRCUITPY/, replace all files and folders. You might have to empty the lib folder if it has old libraries that now takes upp space.
Run the code (should be restarted automacigally, but at least with saves).

Start a new branch "E-level". On this branch you close E-issues and then do a Merge Pull Request via the PR extension when they are all completed. You can also click commit & create Pull Request when committing the last issue in that level. 
Create a new branch "D-level" from your completed E-level branch and continue to work.

Edit the code.py on your CPY and when an issue is solved, copy back (Cmd + A, Cmd + C, Cmd + V) to the local repo, save (Cmd + s) and commit/push with "Resolved #..." message.

* Installera CircuitPython 8.0.0 (follow instructions in Weatherstation)
* Make one commit per issue resolved. Note its only the local repo, not the code on the CPY that is pushed to the remote repo
